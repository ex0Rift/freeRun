# THIS IS THE WEB BRANCH

bare in mind this is the code base changed to work and compile on web including sorce files and it's edited code of the main file to work in it's enviroment



# FreeRun

FreeRun is a personal project of mine where eventually the end product will be a polished 2D ininite platformer.
I am also using it as my oportunity to expand on my knowladge of C by writing this game in C++.

This game was made for [Hackclub Mdinight](https://midnight.hackclub.com "@midnight") which has motivated me greatly to create and love the projects i make
includng this one!

## The game has RELEASED!

The game is finished now! and the way you play is on itch.io [here](https://ex0rift.itch.io/freerun "@freeRun")
I am very proud of this and it's compiled to web to play it as you wish. please check out the WEB branch of this repo to see the compiled code and changes made to be able to run on the game.

Run, jump and speed! this game is a high speed intense experience to beat your highscore and go as fsat as you possibly can!

I am now at the point where I am confident in making the game proceduraly generate chunks, as of now I have properly
polished the movement and falling and jumping parts and the game includes an animation class which are basic fundamentals of the game,
as of now I have started on the chunks being generated around the player (8 at a time) and being generated from a 3D array so it is "procedurally
generated". This is far greater than most projects I have done and I have pushed my limits which is somthing really enjoyable and nice to say!

Currently this is only on a really early build with working out movement and classes but screenshots will be available further into development.

Right now I've focused on the core features of the game. Collision, drawing tiles for a map and over all polish.
Games usually suffer from being too "floaty" so I have spent a vast amount of time adjusting and tweaking the movement
to fell somthing more realistic and nicer to use. Also the collision doesn't try to fake anything, it is made to work and work well with directional collision for the player for accurate stops on the map.
